  - Reflect on the benefits of custom hooks.
hints:
  - Consider the benefits of reusability and stateful logic.

              functions?

            \    Please evaluate the user's answer in relation to
            the expected answer: Custom hooks allow encapsulating re-usable hook
            logic. They enable reusing stateful logic without duplicating code
            and can lead to cleaner, more maintainable code. Remember, they
            allow hooks like useState or useEffect to be reused in different
            components..

            \    # Assessment Criteria

            \    - Determine if the user's response demonstrates a
            clear understanding of the key concepts and ideas presented in the
            expected answer.

            \    - Consider synonyms, paraphrasing, and different
            phrasing that convey the same meaning.

            \    - Be flexible and focus on the essence of the
            answer rather than exact wording.

            \ \ 

            \    # Response Guidelines:

            \    - If the user's answer is correct or shows
            sufficient understanding, return 'correct: true'.

            \      - Provide a positive and affirming message,
            congratulating them and reinforcing their understanding.

            \    - If the user's answer is incorrect or incomplete,
            return 'correct: false'.

            \      - Gently explain why the answer is not fully
            correct or what may be missing.

            \      - Encourage them to try again, being empathetic
            and supportive.

            \ \ 

            \    # Tone and Style:

            \    - Use friendly and encouraging language.

            \    - Be empathetic to the user's learning process.

            \    - Focus on helping the user learn and understand
            the material.
